This is my attempt to continue developing and improving Erin Burt's ComicControl CMS software. I am not a web developer, I'm just a dilettante that knows enough PHP to be able to hack in my own changes.

This repository is provided to assist self-publishing by individuals and not-for-profit entities in accordance with the Intended Use of the Software as defined in the [ComicControl End User Software License Agreement](http://comicctrl.com/full-free-license-text/full-free-license-text). Per section 6.4 of that agreement all changes demonstrated by this repository are the sole property of ComicControl LLC. Use of the software in this repository is subject to the ComicControl End User Software License Agreement.

If you see this I'm sorry, Erin, for all the crap you've gone through the last few years. I'm sorry that you felt the need to step away from ComicControl. Most importantly, I'm sorry for not knowing what the heck I'm doing and for making changes in ways that aren't immediately useful to the other people using this software. If you ever do want to return to the project, I would be happy to work with you (which actually means, happy for you to teach me the right way to do it).
