This is my attempt to continue developing and improving Erin Burt's ComicControl CMS software. I am not a web developer, I'm just a dilettante that knows enough PHP to be able to hack in my own changes.

I don't think I'll ever package my version of ComicControl as its own release, but I will keep this github repo up to date with the code I'm running on my site. Anyone who finds it is welcome to examine what I've done and do it yourself.

If you see this I'm sorry, Erin, for all the crap you've gone through the last few years. I'm sorry that you felt the need to step away from ComicControl. Most importantly, I'm sorry for not knowing what the heck I'm doing and for making changes in ways that aren't immediately useful to the other people using my software. If you ever do want to return to the project, I would be happy to work with you (which actually means, happy for you to teach me the right way to do it).
