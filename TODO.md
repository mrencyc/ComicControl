# TODO list

## High Priority
* Squash bugs (recurring, neverending). Moving to PHP 8 introduced a lot of bugs. There's a more in the installer, which doesn't get as much attention from me as the site code itself. There are probably also bugs from various different web hosting implementations that ought to be addressed.
* Build a wiki module. Functionally, this is like a blog but with the chronological order ripped out. Tags act similarly to how categories on MediaWiki sites work, with a link to an article explaining the tag and a list of all articles with that tag. Wiki articles also retain version history, though there is currently no plans to allow anonymous editing nor automated signups. I would reccomend actual wiki software if you want something more in that vein.
* Use (Candy.css)[https://candy.wavebeem.com/] to make a lightly customizable frontend that works for non-web-savvy artists out of the box, no HTML/PHP/CSS knowledge necessary. Users would be able to customize their site's colors or upload a banner image via the same backend form interface the rest of the site uses. They'll also have access to the template files themselves for direct manipulation, or the ability to use their own template files as is currently allowed.
* Build a Twine game module. This will allow you to upload an html file generated by Twine, which will have unnecessary code stripped out so that it can be embedded directly into the existing site template as if it always belonged there.
* Add support for oEmbed, Open Graph, and Twitter Cards. There is already code in place to generate metadata for each page but it's not optimized for sharing like it should be. When someone links to your comic, the link should unfurl appealingly.
* Add support to auto-generate favicons from a user-supplied file. Users should not have to format their own favicons, they should be able to upload a single file and have it automatically converted to show up as the highest quality version for every platform. ComicControl sites are competing against webcomic apps. As with embeds, they should look as appealing as possible.

## Low Priority

* Multiple images per comic. Modern webcomics platforms like Webtoon and Tapas emphasize very tall scrolling comics made of shorter images stitched together. Currently there is no support for hosting a comic of this style on ComicControl. There should be. Tying multiple images to one comic page probably isn't that complicated, but I'm not sure if the image uploader can recieve multiple images at once. I will need to pick at it a bit before I can figure out how difficult this will be. 
* Basic non-invasive tracking features? It would be nice to see things like referrers or daily hits without resorting to server-side analytics, or even worse Google analytics. This wouldn't be so hard to do but it's also not a big priority.
* Native comments system. There are privacy concerns with using Discus for comments. Unfortunately open comments are also a security risk, so I'd have to be very careful with a home-grown implementation, or find an existing comment library I can plug into comiccontrol.
  
## Unlikely to happen

* AWS integration. I would love to do this but I don't know the first thing about the AWS API. For this to be implemented properly artists should be able to upload directly to AWS as seamlessly as they upload now, and AWS hosted files show up as seamlessly as locally hosted files.
* Anything you suggest. Just kidding, feel free to suggest features you think ComicControl should have and I'll see what I can do.
